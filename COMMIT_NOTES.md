- Visibility buffer caching integrated with pipeline
- SSGI now process at half res instead of full-resolution
- SSR and SSGI are now separated systems
- Added SSAO falloff
- Added shadow-map falloff settings for point and directional lights
- Fixed point lights
- Fixed picking cleaning up visibility buffer
- Fixed gizmo line rendering
- Added fragment culling
- Fixed benchmark 
- Moved active skylight to GPU (previously on Engine which was not accessible through scripts)
- Some optimizations to depth reconstruction methods
