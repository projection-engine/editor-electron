- Added gamma and exposure settings for SSGI
- Rewritten pipeline for SSGI:
- Moved from dual pass box blur and 4 level down-sampling + bilinear up-sampling to 2 level down-sampling + single-pass Gaussian blur. This results in more stable GI data while reducing CPU overhead by a mile.
- Added screen edge factor to SSGI generation to prevent color bleed/pollution when a strong color is at the screen edge.
- Added gamma and exposure controls (ACES was used before to prevent infinite feedback loop)
- Optimization to execution, now SSGI + SSR shader will not execute when the two of them are disabled
- Added clear method to FBO
